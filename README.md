# Reddit Sentiment Analysis Project

This repository hosts the code and data for a sentiment analysis project on Reddit comments, led by Sai Sankeerth Thallapally. The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to classify Reddit comments as either positive or negative.

## Files in the Repository

- `EXPERIMENT-1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the initial experimental phase.
- `EXPERIMENT-2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the second phase of experiments.
- `Final code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the final model for sentiment analysis.
- `database.sqlite`: SQLite database containing Reddit comments.
- `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin`: Pre-trained Word2Vec model from Google News.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries including pandas, nltk, textblob, gensim, keras, sklearn, imblearn, sqlite3

### Installation

1. **Install Python:** Download from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Run `pip install notebook` in your terminal.
3. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Execute `pip install pandas nltk textblob gensim keras sklearn imblearn sqlite3`.

### Running the Notebooks

1. Open Terminal (macOS/Linux) or PowerShell (Windows).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.ipynb` files.
3. Start Jupyter Notebook by running `jupyter notebook`.
4. In the Jupyter browser interface, open the desired notebook.
5. Execute the notebook cells by pressing Shift + Enter, or use the "Run All" option in the toolbar.

### Data and Model Files

- Place `database.sqlite` in the same directory as the notebooks.
- Ensure the `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin` file is correctly referenced in the notebooks.

### Troubleshooting

- Confirm installation of all required libraries.
- If issues arise, try restarting the Jupyter notebook kernel.
- Verify the file paths for `database.sqlite` and `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin`.
